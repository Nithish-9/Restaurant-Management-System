# üë®‚Äçüç≥ Restaurant Management System


## Project Description
Omnifood is an **Web development based Restaurant Management System** that aims to digitalize the process of restaurant operations including **ordering, billing, payment management**. 

The main purpose is to **improve the performance** of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks
would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurant would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 

***For complete details regarding the Functional, Non-Functional Requirements and Analysis Models, you can refer to the detailed [Software Requirements Specification document](https://github.com/Nithish-9/Restaurant-Management-System/blob/main/SRS.pdf).***

## Purpose
This application was developed as a  project for our **Software Engineering (CS303)** Course. The whole class was divided into teams of 3-4 members and each team was assigned a particular module of this Restaurant Management System. Besides coding our own module, at the end, **our team was also given the responsibility to meet other team members, discuss and resolve the issues that they are facing in the application and ultimately take their developed modules and integrate all the modules together into one working application**. This exercise made us familiar with the issues that occur during the integration of modules in real software projects like following consistent database schema, variable names, libraries versions etc.
